# Bike-Store-Relational-Database

## Project Overview
*The primary goal of this project is to analyze the sales data of a bicycle retail chain to generate actionable insights for business growth. The study aims to identify top-selling products, evaluate staff performance, and optimize inventory management to minimize stock-out risks and maintain efficient supply levels.*

## Business Problem

Before implementing data analytics, the bicycle retail chain operated with little visibility into its business performance. The absence of structured data tracking led to several critical operational and strategic challenges:

### 1. Revenue Blindness  
The company lacked insight into which brands, product categories, or individual products generated the most revenue and profit. This made strategic decision-making difficult and often resulted in suboptimal product focus.

### 2. Staff Performance Uncertainty  
Management had no objective way to evaluate sales staff performance. It was unclear which employees were high performers and which required additional training or support.

### 3. Poor Customer Retention Insights  
The business could not identify high-value customers — those who purchased frequently and contributed significantly to total revenue. Without this information, targeted marketing and loyalty initiatives were impossible.

### 4. Inventory Mismanagement  

Inventory decisions were made without data support, leading to two major issues:

- Slow-moving products accumulated as dead stock  
- High-demand bikes frequently went out of stock  

This imbalance resulted in lost sales opportunities, increased holding costs, and reduced customer satisfaction.
