# Bike-Store-Relational-Database

## Project Overview
*The primary goal of this project is to analyze the sales data of a bicycle retail chain to generate actionable insights for business growth. The study aims to identify top-selling products, evaluate staff performance, and optimize inventory management to minimize stock-out risks and maintain efficient supply levels.*

## Business Problem

*Before implementing data analytics, the bicycle retail chain operated with little visibility into its business performance. The absence of structured data tracking led to several critical operational and strategic challenges:

### 1. Revenue Blindness  
*The company lacked insight into which brands, product categories, or individual products generated the most revenue and profit. This made strategic decision-making difficult and often resulted in suboptimal product focus.

### 2. Staff Performance Uncertainty  
*Management had no objective way to evaluate sales staff performance. It was unclear which employees were high performers and which required additional training or support.

### 3. Poor Customer Retention Insights  
*The business could not identify high-value customers — those who purchased frequently and contributed significantly to total revenue. Without this information, targeted marketing and loyalty initiatives were impossible.

### 4. Inventory Mismanagement  

*Inventory decisions were made without data support, leading to two major issues:

*- Slow-moving products accumulated as dead stock
*- High-demand bikes frequently went out of stock

*This imbalance resulted in lost sales opportunities, increased holding costs, and reduced customer satisfaction.

## Our Data-Driven Solution
*To resolve the operational inefficiencies and lack of visibility, I designed and implemented a **Centralized Relational Database System** using PostgreSQL. This solution transformed raw transactional data into actionable strategic insights.*

### Key Technical Implementations:

* **Solved Revenue Blindness:**
* The analysis revealed that revenue was highly concentrated among a few key brands:
  * 1. Trek 4,602,754.35 The dominant revenue driver, indicating strong market demand and brand preference.
    2. Electra 1,205,320.82  A solid secondary contributor, suggesting a stable niche presence.
    3. Surly 949,507.06 A smaller but still meaningful contributor to overall sales.
* Revenue distribution across product categories shows clear customer preferences:
  * 1. Mountain Bikes 2,715,079.53 The highest-performing category, indicating strong demand for off-road and adventure bicycles.
    2. Road Bikes 1,665,098.49 A major segment driven by fitness and long-distance cycling enthusiasts.
    3. Cruisers Bicycles: 995,032.62 — A smaller but stable category appealing to casual riders.
